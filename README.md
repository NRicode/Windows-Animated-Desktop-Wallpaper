## How to use
Simply download this repository, and run `Animated Desktop.exe`, replace the `source.gif` file with any gif file to be displayed. Modify the fps.txt file to modify the wallpaper fps, since .gif files don't have a constant fps, it is recommended to set the value to the gif's average fps (usually gif runs at 24 fps) or higher. The lower the fps and the smaller the gif, the more gpu load you can save.

Press `Shift` + `F1` to close

## Background
Some other animated wallapper can only play video or even webview that definitely takes up a ton of cpu, ram and gpu. This desktop wallpaper is focused on being as lightweight as possible with everything optimized the best as I can. This desktop wallpaper only accept .gif as wallpaper.

## Performance
No additional depedencies. Only consumes around 1% cpu on an i3, 30 mb of memory and 10% gpu load on gtx 1650.
